# Brief
**Why I choose Arduino UNO ?**

- The Arduino UNO is the best board to get started with electronics. 
* If this is your first experience tinkering with the platform, the UNO is the most robust board you can start playing with. 
+ The UNO is the most used and documented board of the whole Arduino family.

Applications
-------------------
Arduino Uno is a popular microcontroller board based on the **ATmega328P microcontroller**. Some common applications of the Arduino Uno include:

* Robotics and automation
* Internet of Things (IoT) devices
* Control systems
* Home automation systems
* Data loggers
* Musical instruments and light shows
* Prototyping and testing electronic circuits
* Automated gardening systems
* Measuring and monitoring systems
* Educational purposes for teaching electronics and programming.

Changes to the original Arduino
-------------------

* **3.3V and 5V suppport** -  Added an option to switch between 5V or 3.3V pin voltage
* **Micro USB connection** - Use any mobile phone or tablet charger to power the board
